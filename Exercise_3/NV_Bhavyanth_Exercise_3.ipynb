            "[\"The film boasts a good storyline with a well-executed Indian superhero flair. Character development is commendable, particularly with the endearing Hanu Man, though the Super villain character could have been more captivating.Teja Sajja shines in his role, delivering a fantastic performance.Getup Seenu's look and performance is fantastic. Satya is fun.Vara Lakshmi portrays her character decently, although her articulation disorder may be distracting; considering this, a dubbing artist might enhance the overall experience.Vinay Rai as the antagonist is visually fitting, and his performance is nothing short of terrific.Amrita Iyer, resembling a side character from Telugu TV serials, gives a lackluster performance, suggesting she may not be best suited for the big screen.The supporting cast performs well, and the film benefits from appealing locations. While the cinematography is pleasing, sets and costumes, while good, lack a certain naturalness.The music is fitting, and the VFX, given the budget constraints, is commendable, even if not groundbreaking.Action choreography could have been better.Some mythological elements might not be entirely convincing, but they are forgivable.Overall, it's a theatrical watch worth considering.\", \"I am glad that i was the audience of this movie. Literally the mid and ending part gives you goosebumps and starting 15 minutes is little slow but when it takes off it doesn't stop. You will enjoy each seconds of the movie and not at all blink your eye after interval. From Kids to Old age people everyone should watch this wonderful movie. Surely i will go again as my family members are also excited after my experience. Please don't mias this movie and watch with your loved one family and friends. Lead actor tried his best in role. Abd overall a great movie to watch some action scenes and the next part will surely more exciting than this as it gives a strong story line for the next movie which will come in 2025.\", \"It's a routine mass entertainer done well, with drama, emotions and well placed laughs. But we all know that's not all, and that's never the focus of the movie. It's HANUMAN, and movie ensure that the audience don't loose focus of it with great cinematography, character and place namings, symbolism, and ofcourse the story arc itself.The Introductory piece of the movie is done in Rajumauli Style ( for the sake of familiarity) and is done nearly as well. You could always see that the VFX team never had enough budget to go all guns blazing. But at the same time, it was evident that they brought all the sincerity and intent to make the best of the available resources and almost always got the basics of VFX right, be it underwater scene, or others.Post the Introductory scene, it takes you through a storyline where arguably it helps to the submit to the director's way of storytelling. In no way, director stretches the style of storytelling and uses extreme exaggeration that we are not already accustomed to Superhero cinema ( in India and beyond) but seeing it being done by not some A listers might through viewers off a little.And post that movie completely submerged itself into a well crafted masala entertainer. Who is the lead before he gets power, how he gets power, how it changes the small villege, how the antagonist and protagonist meets makes the main plot, with his love story, and villege political dynamics makes up the secondary plot on which the rest of movie revolves.But what gets you the screaming on top of your lungs Jai Shri Ram at the end of the movie is the climax that fills you with pride and anticipation of what is going to come next.I watched it in Hindi and the dubbing was pretty neat. A good indicator of that is always how the comedy scenes are dubbed and it was done well to get the hearty laugh out of the audience.WATCH IT TODAY.\", \"The opening segment acknowledges the influence of Marvel and DC superhero films through the character of a boy who hopes that he, too, will be a spiderman after being bitten by a spider. However, this sets the stage for a superpower-thirsty maniac Michael (Vinay Rai) who goes by the moniker M. While M's world is high on technology and the city's night skyline is dotted with high rises, Prasanth Varma contrasts this with the town of Anjanadri, flanked by mountains, valleys and a larger-than-life rock carving of Hanuman.The underdog in this story is Hanumanthu (Teja Sajja), a happy go lucky guy who lives with his sister Anjamma (Varalaxmi Sarathkumar). Anjanadri is set in the parallel world of Akhand Bharath whose inhabitants range from people who have been untouched by urbanisation to a monkey named Koti (with voiceover by Ravi Teja). Sweeping drone shots show a picturesque Anjanadri that is reminiscent of a few fictional kingdoms we have seen in superhero films. The large Hanuman rock carving, at a later point, is effectively used to stage heroic moments, in a nod to Rajamouli's Baahubali.\", \"Hanuman...\\nI can't explain each scene how Prasanth Varma imagined Hanuman the Devotional God, Super Hero.All Characters in movie wow I can praise them lot n lot. Casting Leading Roles, Anatagonist, Comedy all perfectly played their character.I surprise Visual Effects, Back Ground Effect, Story, Screenplay wow that's Amazing.How a Director didn't waste one minute in Entire film that I shocked literally...\\nIndian Devotional stories,Mythology, Science, Technology altogether captured.I would give 10/10.Hopefully collect 10 times returns than Budget in Box Office.Boolywood, Hollywood definitely shocked how Indian especially South Indian movies are coming up with Great Stories that never heard.\", \"Vfx of the movie at such low cost needs to be given a lot praise.

The director's masterful execution seems to have left a lasting impact on you.Exhilarating movie with a blend of localized (village) touch and a simple story, but displayed with a big heart. Director Prashanth Verma has shown rough edges in the first half as you feel it's a typical age old movie with some exciting moments in between. Interval stops with a bang! Second half races with full steam and picks up the pace where he portrays wanna be baddie superhero vs the real superhero. VFX is good given the limited budget.\", \"Well this was in my opinion one of the best movie to start the year,this movie shows if you have potential story and mix it with Great Indian Mythology you can get to greater heights.I am not an VFX or CGI expert but seeing the budget of this movie and of Adipurush it's about 1/20 time, but they had no intention of giving good movie although they had the story which almost everyone knows\\nThis movie shows you can deliver quality and all of the kudos the prashant Verma sir who seamlessly mixed the Mythology and superhero genre,\\nLast Hanuman shots were literally goosebumps🔥May this universe expands more and we get our beloved HANUMAN charging the Superhero army and slaying the villains.

There is a backstory of Villain which gives us reasons and motivations for his flawed character is shown which is refreshing unlike regular villains who are like buggy robots on mission to destroy everything so cruelly to elevate heroInterval Bang is BEST , and Climax you will definitely Hoot , cheer , cry and clap with joyThis is a wholesome entertainment catered for masses , classes , kids , grown ups and whole family can watchDon't miss this masterpiece in theatres where it 100 times worth to watch than on OTT.\", 'Words fall short to express my gratitude towarrds director Prashanth Verma, lead actor Teja Sajja, towards multiple BGM composers, cinematographer and VFX team for achieve such a epic output of a movie with \"Hanuman\".There were several moments where everyone in theater jumped out of their sets to screem Jai Shri Ram, Jai Hanuman, Jai Bhajarang bali and more. The amalgamation of a simple story into the grand itihaasa of Bharathavarsha is a stroke of genius by the master story teller director Prashanth Verma. Complimenting that is the Solid VFX generated. Binding all this is the mind boggling background story. It works every time in the movie.The last 40mins is where the movie peaks. It goes higher higher and higher, leaving everyone with goosebumps when we reach the end credits. People were Screeming Jai Shri Ram all the way, the excitement even carried outside the theater as well.I am still wondering with a minimal budge of 55crores, this team was able to make such a grand movie, what would they with budget which SS Rajamouli gets.', \"Movieis an absolute treat for audiences of all ages. This animated film brings to life the beloved Indian mythological character, Hanuman, with stunning visuals and a heartwarming story.The animation in this movie is top-notch, with vibrant colors and breathtaking action sequences that truly immerse the audience in the world of Hanuman. The attention to detail in depicting the mythology and culture of India is commendable, adding an extra layer of authenticity to the film.The storyline is engaging and beautifully captures the essence of Hanuman's bravery, loyalty, and devotion. The film strikes a perfect balance between action and emotion, making it a thoroughly enjoyable experience for both children and adults. The voice acting is also top-notch, adding depth and personality to the characters.What sets this movie apart is its universal message of courage, sacrifice, and the triumph of good over evil. It inspires and entertains, leaving a lasting impact on the audience.Overall, Hanuman movie 2024 is a must-see for anyone looking for a visually stunning, emotionally resonant film. It's a celebration of Indian culture and mythology, and a reminder of the timeless values that Hanuman represents.\", '\"Hanuman\" is a cinematic gem for true devotees. The film weaves a mesmerizing tale with numerous goosebumps-inducing scenes. The outstanding background music adds a layer of emotional depth, complementing the gripping narrative. The well-crafted songs enhance the overall experience. Remarkably, the VFX, despite a modest 60 crore budget, surpass expectations, delivering visuals that are truly worth the investment. The action sequences are executed with finesse, contributing to the film\\'s overall impact. Characters are thoughtfully utilized, adding richness to the storytelling. In essence, \"Hanuman\" stands out as a captivating blend of compelling narrative, exceptional visuals, and powerful music, making it a must-watch for enthusiasts of divine tales.', \"It's a visual delight for everyone, though adi purush spend over 600 crore still didn't look good but this movie will take you through next level.Most importantly the story line, music, climax and interval were just mind-blowing well made must watch for all devotees of hanuman. Kids especially gonna enjoy a lot. Really waiting for this to turn into a movie Verse. Teja acting was really mature and rest of team also did really well, but full credit goes to the director who has given such a delightful experience to watch and must watch for everyon. This movie should be shown to kids especially rather than showing Hollywood movies. Jai shree ram jai bajrangbali.\", \"If you are a Mythology buff this movie is for you. If you are a Superhero film fan, this movie is for you. If you are looking for artsy content, this movie is not for you.THE ACTING:\\nFortunately, we have gone past the era where simplest of acting skills were missing in lead actors. Almost everyone in this film did what was expected from them.THE CONTENT(STORY):Superhero origin stories are risky, usually missing the mark. This one was different. The story was engaging, comic relief was organic and certainly not over the top. The self-awareness of the characters and the situations around them kept the story grounded. The script was slightly fast paced and somewhat rushed in the second half(typical of Indian films). While the hero's screen time and character arc was well maintained, the antagonist's character was not completely developed. The love story sub plot was managed well.Comedy does not seem imposed and is at no point in time offensive.THE DIRECTION:There were goosebump worthy moments which is a novelty in Indian Superhero films. You will clap a few times. The director certainly was not aiming for classic realism in a superhero film. It has very little artsy and way more mass entertainment. The director knows how to stir up the emotions when watching the film on big screen and he seems to be the right candidate for creating a Cinematic Universe.CGI:In a 20 Crore budget, you cannot expect Avenger level VFX. From the look of it, every single penny is spent judiciously. One would like to see more detailing in superhero fight scenes in the next movies of the Universe.LASTLY:If you are not really trying to be preachy and offensive, audience is smart enough to accept the story at its face value. It has not been the case on most occasions.The way the makers have treated a sensitive topic is commendable..Telugu and other South Indian story writers, actors and directors are way ahead of Bollywood.Indian Myth is a Goldmine for marvellous stories which have been ignored, deliberately. And the adaptations have been disappointing. This movie proves that if unwarranted propaganda is not peddled through film and the content more than the messaging is prioritised, India can make engaging superhero films for the world. No offence, but a 1000 times better content than Bramhastra.\", \"This movie is a peak perfection movie every scene is too good and the detailing to every scene is top notch by #prashanthvarma #prashanthcinematicuniverse.The VFX is too good for the budget they have for this movie.The Casting is also good and Teja Sajja Acted very well and the villain played his role very well.This movie has everything you can ask for so many action scenes and the way the characters have developed is too good you won't get bored watching and there are some comedy scenes in the movie and there are some emotional moments in the film and the climax is too good you just chant #JaiSreeRam\\n#JaiHanuman all the way during this movie.This is the kind of movie to watch on bigger screen without any doubt.This is a Blockbuster movie for sure.Waiting for #JaiHanuMan in cinemas soon.\", \"Wow! This movie was beyond what I expected it to be. I can't believe I was about to miss watching this gem in theatre. I digress, the marketing of this film is both a boon and a curse.Here's something even MCU & DCEU lacks lately - good writing, high stakes, limitations, consequences, plot armor that isn't baseless, villains that aren't one dimensional; this movie made up for it all and more. Though they blatantly took inspiration from a variety of sources, if you can catch it, but justified all of it excellently & befittingly, adding more of original. And bravo for achieving this feat in just a 20 crore budget, putting a lot out there to shame. This is a must-watch combo of science fiction & tradition, especially if you're into the superhero genre.No cap! Looking forward to this franchise. Proud of South Cinema to pull this genre off successfully again after Minnal Murali.\", \"One of the best movie I have seen in recent times after Karthikeyan2. Liked the story, music, vfx and humor. Ignore few dull elements for a while but overall fully enjoyable. Last 15 minutes of climax is literally goosebumps moment. This is beyond expectations and must watch, everyone will be having more proud and deeper faith in our Sanatana dharma. First half mostly contains humor and context setting. A villain is shown with limited time and could have been more focused. However, overall it's a full entertaining movie and shall be enjoyable more in theatres than ott platforms. Have a great time with family and enjoy this HanuMan.Jay Shree Ram 🙏🙏\", 'Director PrasanthVarma crafts a solid entertainer... HanuMan is ambitious and exciting - packs drama, emotions, VFX and mythology skilfully... Loaded with goosebump moments + extraordinary finale... Recommended. The VFX plays a pivotal part, garnishing the goings-on wonderfully, but not once does it overpower the story... Dubbing of all principal characters is appropriate... Only hiccup, the run time could\\'ve been shorter.With solid storytelling, impressive visuals, and strong performances, the film successfully merges elements of mythology with contemporary action, offering a unique viewing experience in Indian cinema.Ever since, we were kids, for us, Hanuman was not just a deity but a superhero in his own right, who is a testament to his deep devotion, loyalty, and dedication to Lord Rama, making him a revered figure in Hindu mythology for his selfless service and unwavering commitment to dharma (righteousness). And, the film Hanu Man amplifies that sentiment, making it a delightful experience for audiences of all ages.\"Wherever there is righteousness, Lord Hanuman prevails.\"', \"Jai Shree Ram that's what the film is all about to bring the greatest heroism of the real life and never ending divine power who is worshipped every time and with God Ram God Hanuman Tejj Sejja brings great performance it proves when the soul is right vfx will be seen great themselves that too on such a low budget last 20 minutes can bring even in death that's what the film is all about one can surely enjoy the film all over and a must watch in theatres something that one must enjoy throughout the time one of the best films in recent time great job by Vinay Rai who brings an anti Batman style villain Amrita Arya does a great support too\\nJai Shree Ram.\", \"I cannot tell you how i felt\\nFirst Jai Bajrangbali Jai Shree Ram you can't afford to miss this movie this is one of a experience that is a must experience please experience it on theatre #HanuMania #hanuman.You are just watching something which you have never seen before it has everything what you can expect in a film\\nI cried\\nI laugh\\nI prayed\\nEverything what you want in an movie it is available on this movie so please do not miss this and go to theatre and experience this i never write this long for any movie but this movie made me write about it at the end Jai Shree Ram Jai Hanuman Jai Bajrangbali.\", \"My 2024 film journey started with a bang with an original Indian superhero movie!Imagine my shock when they show our hero letting his parents die in a fire because superheroes like Spider-Man and Batman don't have their parents to tell them what they can or cannot do. Turns out, it is actually the supervillain's origin story. I absolutely loved the film. I was having a deja-vu, then I remembered he was also the villain in Tamil superhero film Veeran.I love that they make self-aware jokes about Telugu masala filmmaking and how Telugu heroes are already superheroes. Story works, humour works, origin stories work, action and visuals work big time. What Prashanth Varma has managed to accomplish with the budget is nothing short of mindblowing. Why was that monkey giving commentary lmao.It's a brilliant integration of Indian mythology into science fiction/superhero genre although I do believe using Hindu gods directly in fictional narratives for entertainment is not right and is almost indistinguishable from the use of Greek, Norse, Egyptian gods in western films, shows or video games because they aren't worshipped anymore. In any case, this is a promising start to the Prashanth Varma Cinematic Universe and I will be there for Adhira and Jai Hanuman.This is a proper superhero film. So expect lots of gadgets, drones, body freezing gas, smoke bombs, science fiction like monitor displays on thin air, superpowered suits but the thing to note here is that these are all used by the supervillain. Rat bodies explode in experiments gone wrong and there is a fair amount of blood too. Pretty cool visuals and not only are most of the ideas never seen before in an Indian film but the film also promises a whole lot more. The last 15 minutes are simply amazing to say the least. Trust me, you just have to see it with your own eyes. Theater experience is something else. Hats off to Prashanth Varma. Jai Hanuman! Jai Shree Ram!\", \"One the best climax have seen in spritual movie..\\nVFX acting dialogues direction. Everything was top notch.Loaded with goosebump moments + extraordinary finale... Recommended. The VFX plays a pivotal part, garnishing the goings-on wonderfully, but not once does it.The supporting cast, while not exceptional, manages to fulfill the requisite roles demanded by the narrative. Their performances, though not outstanding, suffice for the needs of the film. The climax, however, stands out as a well-executed sequence, setting the stage intriguingly for potential sequels.In summary, the movie possesses commendable aspects, including a noteworthy climax and solid technical elements. However, the narrative's weaknesses, coupled with a less impactful hero and underwhelming comedic moments, prevent it from achieving its full potential. The groundwork laid in the climax for future sequels adds an intriguing layer to the overall cinematic experience.We all can connect with Lord Hanumanji\\nJay Shri Ram.\", \"Story and direction 10/10\\nExecution 10/10\\nActing 9.5/10\\nVFX 8.5/10\\nEnding scene 1000/10\\nVillain 6/10This is what can be achieved when the heart is in the right place. What adipurush couldn't do with a budget of more than 500 crores, Hanu man did it with around 30 crores. The ending sequence was outstanding I had goosebumps for 5 min straight. By far the best superhero movie made in India. My only gripe is with the villain. The story of the villain was good but the villain could have been better and the team could have made a better costume. Can't wait to see the next part. This is a movie I will watch again and again and not get bored. Hats off.\", 'The first half is fine, story is somewhat engaging, but the second half is slower than serial. There\\'s more of P**n than the typical \"animal\" behavior.And typical of Sandeep\\'s previous movies, the heroine is useless. And senseless fight scenes, useless guns and shootings, hard to follow. Main villain comes only in the last 30 minutes, they fight for straight 6 - 7 minutes, what is this WWE? And nobody knows the reason for some of the fights.I guess this is a movie version of a typical soap opera. He should name it \"Movie to not watch\" instead of \"Animal\". Sentiment wasn\\'t much. God knows how characters accepted such movie. So much of dragging, useless senseless kiss scenes that are out of place. Second half is just a synonym for headache. This has two heroines that have no purpose or place in the story. I still didn\\'t understand what sandeep wanted to portray.Actual story can be completed in 30 minutes. Sandeep should stop making movies.', \"Long, Loud, Boring, Gory, Tiring. The movie starts off well, but turns out to be a disaster. The movie is a long drawn violent drama affair which doesn't end. Let's not talk about the story (there isn't one).Bobby Deol (the superstar of the 90s) is wasted, merely a cameo appearance and something his fans won't accept (no spoilers). Go watch his Gupt, Soldier, Ajnabee again!Ranbir's performance is fine, but being a mainstream actor of Indian cinema, should NOT have signed this torturous endless movie. I'm sure Ranbir will lose some of his loyal family fan base - but does it matter in the society we are living? I wonder if he read the script in full. His Shamshera is a far better movie than this so called Animal.At one of the marketing premieres for Animal, Ranbir said he prefers Sandeep over Rajamouli as the director. C'mon, Rajamouli Sir is one of the best directors India has ever produced and there is no comparison.If you are a hardcore Ranbir fan and would like to see Sandeep Reddy's Animal at any cost, go for it but don't forget to keep a Paracetamol with you.\", \"Guys, do not waste your time and money on such a piece of waste. None of the religions, whether Punjabi or Marathi, promotes violence. What is this movie trying to portray? Disrespect towards elders, murders, extramarital affairs under the guise of fatherly love. Seriously? These are pan-India movies, and such films destroy the reputation of the country and its residents abroad. Is the Indian police and army a joke? Open firings by a kid in public, 100 murders without any legal actions - is Indian law a joke? I don't know what the ideal message was, but it was definitely a story of the worst parenting and a criminal psycho kid. Seriously disappointed by Ranbir. He's such a brilliant actor, but what a terrible script.\", '\"Animal\" beautifully explores the complexities of the father-son bond, adding emotional depth to its gripping narrative. This exploration of the father-son bond enhances the film\\'s emotional resonance, making \"Animal\" must-watch for those seeking a cinematic experience that combines gripping storytelling and exceptional acting.Ranbir Kapoor takes the film to new heights, delivering a nuanced and powerful performance. Rashmika Mandanna\\'s presence adds a layer of brilliance, showcasing her exceptional acting skills\\nThis is entirely new to me; I haven\\'t encountered anything like it before.4.5/5.', \"Like Kabir singh this movie also don't have any story. Only psycho violent character development movie. I was expecting good story line but movie was disppointing. Acting in the movie is good but whats the use of acting if movie don't have storyine .Female character are there just for sex in the movie. Even animal planet channel having better story of animals. Director of the movie needs some mental treatment so that he can think something meaningful. If you compare to other action movies atleast they have some story and editing of the movie is stupid. In the end you will be like wtf we watched.\", \"Vijay (Ranbir Singh) is obsessed with his father Balbir Singh (Anil Kapoor), going to any extent to win his approval. Other than being extremely obsessed, Vijay is also an alpha male. The privilege he is born with, makes him be all the things he perceives to be the qualities of an alpha male. He goes conquering every he lays his eyes on except his father's approval. When Balbir Singh is attacked, Vijay comes back seeking vengeance and all hell breaks loose. Who attacked Balbir? What is their connection with Balbir's family? Will Vijay ever get tired of devouring his demons, forms rest of the story.Sandeep Reddy Vanga got triggered a lot due to the harsh criticism he received for Kabir Singh from a small section of critics and vowed to make the most violent film, which he succeeds. He didn't say anything about making a good film and that reflects in the second half. For what it's worth, the 1hr 45mins long first half was indeed terrific and Ranbir Kapoor is presented in never seen before avatar (not just Ranbir but any Bollywood hero in general). The non-linear narrative helps and so does the excessive violence. Everything Vanga has cooked up in the first half worked superbly.The second half is where the film stumbled big time as the weak script and barring Ranbir's Vijay, every other character being underwritten, badly pulls down the film. Excessive of everything will become unbearable and that is exactly what happens in the second half. Atleast the first half had hero elevations and gave him a purpose to help connect with the character. But in the second half, the writing undoes everything turning Vijay into this massive jerk than an animal and it is only Ranbir's performance that tries to be the film's savior.Speaking of underwritten roles, it is exactly here where Sandeep Reddy Vanga fails. Everything strictly remains on the surface level, be it the father-son relationship or husband-wife. We are told the reason for the enmity between Balbir's family and that of Abrar Haque (Bobby Deol) but it is never effectively established what their backstory was. It simply settles to bunch of wild nasty men going at each other with unnecessary amount of violence. Even Tripti Dimri's Zoya is so poorly written, the character's action at the crucial point made no sense whatsoever.Coming back to Vijay and Geetanjali's (Rashmika) relationship, it is somewhat an extended version of Arjun-Preeti / Kabir-Preeti though Geetanjali gets to take charge of couple of situations, only to give in. Just having the couple talk about their sex life openly or even fight using sex in the argument alone isn't enough to sell their love story. Anil Kapoor's Balbir sadly gets sidelined in the second half, only to get a proper scene in the end. All of this is what makes the entire second half feel so empty. But, the post credit scene was indeed very good.Overall, Ranbir Kapoor's terrific performance definitely deserved a better second half. I am going with a lenient rating just for that first half, Ranbir Kapoor and the post credit scene.\", \"I went into this movie expecting a never seen before story. The story was simple and nothin more than that but Ranbir Kapoor.... God damn man he is the best actor in India right now. He pulled it off with such ease and elevated the movie on another level. It is a well shot movie in my opinion and vanga has made a great movie to showcase the acting skills of such a great talent. The 1st half of the movie is amazing and goes with such smoothness. I felt the movie dip a bit in the second half and that romance angle could've been out to the side. Bobby Deol was a game changer but really underutilized. He should've gotten more screen time and a better backstory. Anil Kapoor as well was amazing and did a great job with his given role. The movie won't bore you at all because Ranbir Kapoor is taking up almost all of the 3 hours in this movie and he makes you wanna sit there and admire his work in each frame. The violence in the movie is gritty but not as much as I expected it to be. But overall, a good movie with great acting and also, do not take your kids. You will regret it.\", \"Wasting talent like Ranbir Kapoor by casting him in a South Indian film. For the movie to work, it should have portrayed Ranbir as a meta or superhero to justify his action scenes.Imagine the richest man in India whose son aspires to be a gangster. If this were set in Ludhiana's affluent society, it would still make sense.If the main character is depicted as an individual with such ruthless tendencies, why did he choose not to torture the fake mole, but later, he is willing to harm a pregnant woman? This man, in the beginning, declares he will not deceive his wine but contradicts himself later.In reality, children with toxic fathers do not usually turn out to be such ruthless individuals. Although they may dislike their fathers, this movie seems to portray an exaggerated and overly dramatic scenario.\", \"A son's love for his father pits him against an anonymous assassin with a grudge.Animal is a whopping 3 hours and 22 minutes, and I don't think that includes the interval. The first half of the film is mostly overwrought familial drama and, to be honest, I was quite bored, much of the cultural stuff that seemed to be entertaining the largely Indian audience going way over my head. There weren't even any elaborate song and dance numbers to lighten the mood (I thought musical numbers were mandatory in Bollywood movies).I did, however, perk up when, immediately before the interval, the first action scene occurs, as anti-hero Ranvijay Singh (Ranbir Kapoor) hacks away at countless animal mask wearing enemy henchmen with a pair of axes before mounting a vehicle armed with enormous machine guns and blasting the remaining bad guys into oblivion. If this was an indication of the cartoonish OTT violence to come in the second half, I figured the hard slog of the past 90 minutes would have been worthwhile.Unfortunately, that blistering action scene proves to be the highlight of the whole film: the remainder of the film consists of more drama that seems to be building towards an exciting testosterone-fuelled climax but which culminates in a less than thrilling bout of fisticuffs between Ranvijay and villain Abrar Haque (Bobby Deol).5/10. I might have enjoyed it more if I had understood some of the humour, and, with such a long runtime, I think there should have been much more action, and at least one highly choreographed musical interlude (the song sung by Ranjivay's 'brothers' during the fight scene doesn't count).N. B. I loved the soundtrack, especially the spaghetti western style song Papa Meri Jaan and the haunting Hua Main - in fact, it is possibly the best thing about the film.\", \"It is not what they showed ous in trailers it was too much boring the film is around 3 hour 30 minutes long and you will regret wasting that time . And who has written those dilogues they are pathetic just pathetic when ever they are silent it looks good . You know what this film should be called MALARKEY. It was so disappointing and as always VFX is just bad. The problem is not that there are too many dilogues but the problem it that dilogues are boring. In house of the dragon there are also dilogues but they are engaging dilogues should be like that only . And maybe for what you are going for the film there won't be it.\", 'Psychological torture and nightmare of 3:22:00 , they are trying to mislead public with father and son relationship but nothing is shown their as expected, this is not a movie for children this movie should be R -rated because a lot of violence is their, it is combination of top 4 south indian action movies it can only be replicated in Gta5, a lot of unrealistic action we can see in movie ranbir kapoor is killing a lot of people very easily no police and no law we see in this movie every second scene some unrealistic events are happening , blood used as holi colours, not sure about the writer message from this movie but it seems like rich mens son is above the law and can play with it as he wants I think this is the message of movie.', \"The existence of this movie seems rather questionable, as the creators seem to have grappled with a sense of confusion in determining a coherent pattern to follow. This uncertainty is palpable as they have amalgamated various elements, often resembling clear copies of the popular John Wick series. It appears they embarked on a venture of merging multiple templates, a creative endeavor that unfortunately culminated in a puzzling blend of disparate elements. Despite these shortcomings, it's worth noting that the movie does manage to salvage some positive aspects, particularly in the realm of its musical compositions, where certain songs stand out and contribute to a more enjoyable cinematic experience.\", \"Such a cringe and predictable movie from mister Vanga and somewhere looks like Ranbir is desperately trying to become a superstar. Is it Vangas direction or is it Ranbir's acting that is awful and over the top?Weak narrative. The movie is running on its strong background score and style factor, which too becomes bland after a while due to many fights and repeats. Also , feels like Ranbir is imitating Sanjay dutt from yesteryears. Not sure why Rashmika even picked up the role or why she was cast. I wish I had the option to rewind so I could understand what she's trying to say. Bobby deol and Anil Kapoor are the better looking actors in this movie, yet one struggles through the torture of 3.5hrs.\", \"I am really disappointed and shocked by the movie. Despite the trailers being enticing, I anticipated a strong comeback from Ranbir Kapoor. While his acting is commendable, the overall execution of the movie, including its story and plot, was excessively barbaric and brutal in nature.The film, regrettably, contains scenes that render it unsuitable for family viewing. The portrayal of women's cruelty and the depiction of individuals with unstable minds contribute to the movie's unsettling nature, detracting from its cinematic essence.It is imperative to caution against viewing this film with one's family. Ranbir Kapoor, an inherently gifted actor, elevates his performance to an unparalleled level with intense dedication to his role. However, the question arises as to whether he should engage in projects that seemingly forsake humane values. Despite acclaim at the box office, the movie's reception on OTT platforms appears less favorable.Bobby Deol's role, though brief, portrays another manic character. While initial interest may be piqued by a song teaser, subsequent exposure left me disgusted. Furthermore, the movie is replete with senseless action, heavily drawing inspiration from other films, notably a scene from Maula Jatt.In summary, the viewing experience leaves a bad sense of discontent and a bitter taste in your mind.Not at all worth seeing.\", 'I recently had the unfortunate experience of watching a movie that was not only an abomination in terms of storytelling but also an exercise in excessive runtimes. The film in question was a seemingly endless marathon of nonsensical scenes, pointless dialogue, and a plot that could only be described as an insult to the art of storytelling.First and foremost, the story was so poorly constructed that it left me wondering if the writers had forgotten the basic principles of narrative coherence. The plot meandered aimlessly, lurching from one incoherent subplot to another, with no apparent connection or relevance to the overall story. Characters popped in and out of scenes with no clear motivation or purpose, leaving me perplexed and utterly disengaged from their fates.Furthermore, the individual scenes seemed to serve no function other than to waste precious minutes of my life. I struggled to find any semblance of meaning or significance in the endless stream of dialogue and action. At times, it felt as though the filmmakers were simply throwing ideas at the wall in the hope that something would stick, but alas, nothing did.To add insult to injury, the movie clocked in at an excruciating three-plus hours. Three hours of my life that I will never get back. I found myself checking the time, hoping against hope that the end was nigh, only to discover that I still had another hour of agony to endure. It was a cruel and unusual punishment, and I can only assume that the filmmakers were determined to test the limits of human endurance.The Climax Was So Bad With Silly Fight Scenes With No Point At All. Bobby Deol Has A Very Stupid And Weak Role In This Movie.', \"I have no words to express. What a fantastic movie. And Ranbir Kapoor was fantastic in this movie. Great direction.The songs ,the background music everything was awesome. But this is not meant for all audience. Lots of violence is here in this movie.I am mesmerized by Ranbir's acting. I think no other actor can perform like this in this role.After Shahrukh Khan I think he is the next king of Bollywood. He got the all the talent to become a superstar. He is superstar now, but he will be the top king of Bollywood.Director has done a great job. The making of the movie is awesome. Great editing, great making.Superb movie.\", \"For me an actor should have sound voice like raj Babbar in Aaj ki Awaz.simple but cruel against criminals or like Amitabh in andha kanoon.ranbir kapoor has a romantic voice which doesn't fit with this type of role.this film has touch of South Indian movie where a hero can kill 50 villains in one bout or can thrash 10 goons.I have seen his other movie tjmm a zero level film given hype by the media.just watch Shakti.no hooliganism,a simple soft movie on father son relationship.both actor were normal in whole film whereas there were murders too.these type of movie suits to sunny Deol or Sanjay Dutt.for me Ranbir should not take these ventures in future.media can hit this movie but movie will not remain in viewers mind even after 15days.\", 'One word to sum up the experience is Gu ! Gu ka Dhela ! Pathetic unintentional funny experience ! Nothing has changed in the universe. Ranbir Kapoor is still playing the same sob roles where he takes it seriously but movies are bad and Bobby Deol is still a bad actor. Songs and editing are specially bad. Vanga is a bad bad director working on a PR machine. Storytelling sucks as there is no story at all. When is Indian cinema going to learn and not copy the mindless movies created by Hollywood. Movie was as incoherent as this review and my headache. Nothing makes sense as I said gu ka dhela !!!!', \"Worst movies I have seen till date.Teaser and trailer are way different than what the actual movie is. 80% of Screen time is of Ranbir Kapoor, which you will feel irritated watching after some time. His acting feels good for first half hour but then it's same confused feelings on his face for the rest of the movie.Anil Kapoor did his job well, Rashmika was given a very stupid role which she tried hard but failed to perform.Coming to main part - Bobby Deol.He shared less than 5 mins of screen time in the whole movie but nailed out his character, can also say that he is the only person who kept movie watchable.BGM is too loud that you would miss hearing the dialogues.Movie floats in many different time zones which confuses the audience about what's going on. Worst Climax and post credit scenes.P. S.: If you are a woman, please skip this movie, women are portrayed in a very bad state.\", \"Worst movie ever seen. No story no proper dialogue just fake action. Beating eachother whole movie and absurd no sense making scenes. Don't know wth i watched. Never recommend and once again Bollywood is just crap. They showed how absurd they are. Ladies dont go at all just crappy intimate secens to attract audience. Whole movie is just papa papa papa nothing else. Waste of time.

Those 8 'mustandas' are there to sing a song while Ranvir does all his battles. Again, No character to them at all.Bobby, is there for a reason. He comes to a movie, kills a few innocent people, and dies. That is it. One of the worst final boss fights in a movie ever. I was so bored out.At last Ranvir comes forward with his father, does a papa-papa scene, I was like 'WHAT THE F--- BRO'.. I don't know what the director thinks. For 3 and some stupid hours, it was like a hot mess with stupid actions. SUDDENLY!

Don't find the logic just go with emotions you will enjoy the movie. The bgms are really nice and addictive. First half is very intriguing and you will not know when it is completed. There lot of goosebumps moments and really like the classroom scene and the birthday party scene. The interval scenes is abng in the theatre. Another highlight moment is when all the brothers come along and meet his father. The emotions between husband and wife are shown true reality and the love. The entry of zoya took it to another level and I really love her presence.\", '\"ANIMAL\" is a cinematic masterpiece that left me awe-inspired. It\\'s been ages since I encountered a film where every element seamlessly falls into place. The storyline weaves a touching narrative, tugging at the heartstrings with its emotional depth. The performances are nothing short of exceptional, bringing characters to life in a way that resonates long after the credits roll. What truly sets \"ANIMAL\" apart is its impeccable balance of a compelling story and jaw-dropping action sequences. The movie is a symphony of emotions and thrilling moments, creating an unforgettable cinematic experience. A rare gem that redefines what a movie can be.', '\"Animal\": A Critical Exploration of a Film Lost in SenselessnessAs I jot down these words amidst the second half of \"Animal\" unfolding on the big screen, my overwhelming sentiment is one of bewilderment. Who, in the realm of cinematic creation, birthed this perplexing narrative? The script, devoid of coherence, stands as a testament to senselessness, leaving me grappling with the bewildering plot-or rather, the lack thereof.At its core, \"Animal\" seems to revel in the absence of a substantial storyline. It\\'s as if the creators tossed logic aside in favor of a chaotic collage of scenes that lack cohesion. A film should engage, challenge, and provoke thought, yet \"Animal\" seems content to meander aimlessly, leaving the audience with nothing to grasp onto.The script, a crucial backbone for any cinematic endeavor, emerges as the weakest link in this production. Dialogue exchanges feel forced, devoid of the nuanced subtleties that breathe life into well-crafted conversations. The characters navigate through a maze of inanity, their motivations and actions appearing arbitrary and detached from any discernible plot structure. It\\'s a cinematic puzzle with pieces that refuse to fit together.The most disheartening aspect of \"Animal\" is its apparent catering to insecure masculine fantasies. The film lingers on tropes and clichés that perpetuate a narrow and regressive view of masculinity. Rather than offering a nuanced exploration of characters and relationships, it panders to a dated and one-dimensional perspective. This reliance on tired stereotypes does a disservice to both the audience and the potential the film may have had for genuine exploration and reflection.A film devoid of a compelling plot and meaningful character development can only sustain itself through other means-cinematography, perhaps, or a stellar cast. However, \"Animal\" struggles even on these fronts. The visual composition lacks a distinct identity, failing to elevate the mundane script into a visually arresting experience. Despite a cast that may possess individual talents, the collective chemistry falls flat, hindered by the weight of a directionless narrative.In the midst of this cinematic quagmire, it\\'s essential to acknowledge that subjective preferences play a role in shaping one\\'s perception of a film. Some may find solace in the visual aesthetics or draw enjoyment from the chaotic meandering, but for those seeking substance and coherence, \"Animal\" leaves much to be desired.In conclusion, \"Animal\" emerges as a film adrift in the vast ocean of senselessness. Its script, void of logic, and plot, caters to the lowest common denominator, perpetuating stereotypes that undermine the potential for genuine exploration. While a film can be forgiven for its shortcomings, the absence of a cohesive narrative and meaningful character development renders \"Animal\" a forgettable and frustrating cinematic experience. As the credits roll, one is left pondering not the intricacies of the plot, but the inexplicable choices that led to the creation of this cinematic enigma.', 'This movie doesnt glorify toxic masculinity. It shows how the void in mc heart due to lack of love and attention from his beloved father creates a toxic love in his heart because of which he is willing to do anything just to get a tap on his back from his father , who is never happy with him no matter how much he tries to be a good son. This toxic love destroys all of his relationships . He is such a good father and a loving husband but his toxic love for his father ends up destroying those relationships too and the only thing that brings him back from the dark place is the love that his son has for him, unlike his father.The action in this movie is actually good, it doesnt hero worship ranbir or have him say a dialogue in low pitch voice to be scary.Didnt expect bollywood to create such a movie but it is absolutely amazing.', \"The plot of movie is, Save my dad, kill 100's of people, show how people are butchered, show blood, objectify women show their flesh...if you want to see hell this is the movie...\\nLiterally they have shown how women are treated in worst of life, i felt like i am watching something that is happening in terrorist land..\\nDisturbing movie, i would recommend not to watch if you want to be in peace and happy, if you want to disturbed in your peace watch this. And horrible part is that they have a part 2 of this which is more pathetic than this.Sometimes it feels that Ranbir kapoor has portrayed how he is in real life.\", 'So, I\\'ve finally returned home from the evening screening of \"Animal,\" and I have a lot to talk about, so let\\'s get started.Positives:-1.

I\\'ve always admired this man and his natural acting abilities; Vanga has really taken him to the next level, and Ranbir has absolutely dedicated himself to the role he plays. You can absolutely question or even condemn the character for the choices he makes, but you cannot overlook the exceptional acting on display.2. Action & Violence - The second strongest aspect of this execution, and to be honest, we all knew it coming. Vanga pledged to deliver violence, and he kept his word. One of the most spectacular scenes of combat (the interval block) produced in Indian cinema. However, some viewers accustomed to Hollywood or international cinema may find the gore unsatisfactory!3. Confrontation Sequences - There are three main ones in the film (Ranvijay and Varun, Ranvijay and Geetanjali, and Ranvijay and Balbir), and all three had a tremendous impact on me. Wonderful work!Negatives:-1. Lack of Emotional Drive - There was enough of drama and tension in the narrative, with a revenge factor at the forefront, but I couldn\\'t connect to the protagonist\\'s motive or drive, or any of the other characters for that matter. This is mostly caused by a lack of emotional depth, which has robbed the narration of its desired attribute.2. Father-Son Dynamic Wastage - Every promotional material for the feature suggested a neatly constructed Father-Son relationship, with multiple layers and shades to explore and examine. However, that did not happen, and we were forced to settle for a one-dimensional portrayal of the said dynamic, which felt too banal, too rudimentary.3. Choppy Editing and Incoherent Writing - Those who know my film preferences and palate know how much I advocate for non-linear storytelling and experimental filmmaking, but that\\'s only applicable if the script has a certain flow to it and the narration doesn\\'t dither about its main course at play. \"Animal\" unfortunately loses its way in the middle, especially during the second half.Mixed:-1. Humour - A couple of lines made me laugh, but the rest of the lines constituted for comedy fell flat and looked unwarranted and out of place!2. Music - Songs like Arjan Vailly, Papa Meri Jaan, and Pehle Bhi Main matched the story gracefully and immediately pulled me in, but other tracks like Satranga and Saari Duniya Jalaa Denge were criminally underutilised.3. Bobby Deol as Abrar Haque - The look of Bobby created so much buzz on social media that a large number of people (including me) were ecstatic to see him in a dark, sinister avatar like never before, but Sandeep Reddy Vanga had other intentions. It\\'s a shame to see a veteran like Bobby given only fifteen minutes of screen time, and that without the requisite amount of depth or context, resulting in a half-baked cameo at best!4. The Rest of the Supporting Cast - Rashmika, who played both the romantic interest and the wife, did a good job in a number of scenes (particularly near the end), but her character only had so much to express. Tripti Dimri, who played Zoya, had an even smaller role, which seemed unfair to me given her talent as an actor. Anil Kapoor, on the other hand, didn\\'t have much to do except get upset and yell at his wife and children. Monotony hits again!Conclusion: If you know what you\\'re getting yourself into, I feel you\\'ll be able to get the most out of this show; if not, better to proceed with caution.', \"No story, No character development. Acting is just average. Unnecessary nudity. Glorified abuse especially to women. Filled with misogynistic jokes, a film made for today's Alpha males who's masculinity is just limited to assaulting women and fighting goons. This is the worst film of this decade come from Bollywoond industry.This film is totally waste of time, the length of film is literal snooze fest alongside it's crappy storyline. It seems like Ranbir picking a worse character than all the manchild and playboy he plays in mostly movies. The female leads are in the film for nothing but to make out. This is literally disgusting.\", \"The acting's great but the storyline's horrendous. It shows too much of blood and infighting, which I personally feel is not recommendable for people to watch. There's too much of obsession with son-father bond (kind of is derogative). Chances that people might even get false inspiration from the movie to portray those acts in reality. Likewise, the storyline features degrading personality of the character- innocent little kid to an early adult full of hormonal imbalances (which was great and intriguing) but suddenly to a criminal, killing and subduing counter parts without mediation and dialogues. The movie as well glorifies school shooting- a sacred sanctum of knowledge and learning. How did the CBFC even certify this movie without a proper screening of all those derogative scenes? Corruption?\", \"Where is police in this movie.....writer please consult with doctor before writing any story. You have wasted my hard earn money n time.No acting, no story, no suspense, no thriller, just copy paste from all region movie and want to earn money and wasting people time.Why Ranbir why what is the use of acting if u choose this ghatiya scriptdon't gonot for theaternot for familynot for childrenno messageno storyno impactweakness.Are you guy out of mind showing nudity as means of earning....how could one give money to produces such type of films write some meaningful story that can spread awareness.\", \"Animal , This movie is a modern Mahabarath a family rivalry. Stroy, Sandeep just nailed it and made the best master piece of his career,son's love for his father, relationship bonding with siblings, his love for sisters, wife and family. Ranbeer is as always the best at his acting career , he just gave an animal out of him to the audience. Bobby is the next one who gave his best , Anil as usual he is our Mr India at acting... Music is ok and short love story... I am sure you will enjoy the movie... the best part of the movie is parenthood which directly reflects on the mental behaviour of kids..\", \"I walked inside the cinema with a lot of expectations and hope, to be honest their might have been a few flaws in the storyline but one thing it does not miss on is keeping the viewers on their toes every second until the very end to a point where after the movie it took me some time to come back to reality. I am not a big fan of action films but used to love those john wicks anyway, that said I never much enjoyed the Indian action genre with people flying around the room with punches and the hero being faster than the enemy's bullets but that is not the case here, there is a story line that stands its grown more often than not and there are strong emotional scenes that drive the movie to it's climax. Overall it was bang for the buck kind of an experience. Totally recommended.\", \"What a an amazing movie. I have never seen such a close to perfect hindi movie for a very long time or ever. I felt all the emotions fun, anxiety, sadness, rage etc etc. Superb performance by everyone including the ones who played the small roles. It's a must watch but only for Adults. Though this is not for everyone, being that said it's experience would be 10 times better in the theaters. The background music the action sequence the intensity of the scenes.Simply amazing. Easley the best work of Ranbir Kapoor so far. Rashmika Mandhana did really well as his wife as well as Anil Kapoor pulled off an epic performance.\", \"One of the best movies I have watched in a while. Sandeep Reddy Vanga is a true genius. He challenged status quo like never before. Ranbir and Anil Kapoor gave brilliant performances as well. I am certain that this film will have reconsolidated Ranbir's reputation in the industry as a star. A thorough entertainer and certainly his father's worthy son.Ultimately the secret of the success lay in the direction since it is the director who brings out the best in his actors and Sandeep Reddy Vanga has always been a champion in this field. Even minor characters like Prem Chopra and Tripti Dymrii were amazing in their limited screentime. Great way for Bobby Deol to make a comeback. The scenes and the realistic acting will always be memorable. The film certainly is a reality-check for many (as is evident for those who are unnecessarily unnerved by this masterpiece). Eagerly waiting for the sequel.\", 'What a movie mindblowing. Ranbir kapoor is one of the best actor. And one of the best movie 2023s.. and what a violence. Ranbir kapoor and boby deol face of scene outstanding.. and sandeep reddy vanga one of the best and talented actor., and also ranvir kapoor and rashmika pair superb.. and also ranvir kapoor and anil kapoor what a performance.. fast to last you never bore. And climax scene and post credit scene different level.. and every actor act well performed.. and gun scene one of the best.. and action scene is very very brutal. This movie also crose 1000 crore in box ofice.. one of the best movie 2023.', \"I watched it OTT because I had promised someone that I would watch it. I took a few breaks, not because of the gore -- but because of how pathetic this movie is. Moreover, it looks like they didn't pay the editor his fee and he took his revenge by editing this movie in a psychotic manner. I am struggling to find any character in this movie who is NOT a psychopath (and that includes the primary school teacher who spanks the kids hand with cane for no good reason) or a complete moron (like some of the house staff shown in the movie). Ranbir's wife is shown as a nice sweet girl in the beginning but appears to get a bit unhinged in the later part of the movie.There is no Police to be found anywhere in the movie even as hundreds (perhaps thousands) are shot point blank. Ranbir's character kills his brother-in-law with his bare hands in a crowded corporate event but clearly everyone forgot to report the murder as Ranbir's wife was clueless until much later in the movie.Ranbir goes from surgeries to heart transplant to get super fit to fight a brutal fight in months. While he is supposedly recovering there are a few odd earthy jokes (or supposed to be jokes) thrown in between his sudden psychotic rants. Ranbir's obsession with his dad is not only unbelievable but poorly explained. Ranbir's dad (Anil Kapoor) is yet another psychopath who is shown to be screaming at the top of his lungs for most of his scenes.Perhaps all these crazy characters in the first half make the villain (Bobby Deol) look relatively sane when he comes in. Thankfully he is mute so he doesn't go on crazy rants (making him look a bit cooler than the main character)All in all, the storyline is non existent, one scene jumps to another without any coherence or logical consistency. It is a typical masala movie formula -- come up with a few scenes (violent fight scene, sex scene, comedy scenes) first and then somehow put all of them together.I am surprised that this movie was such a big hit despite of all its errors. I can only conclude that it was meant to appeal to beta males who dream of being a macho man. In that sense this movie does seem to succeed. After all, the senseless twists and turns may be just as probable (or improbable) as the beta's dream of becoming an alpha one day.\", \"It's just an epic flop with no connection and basics of present day relationships. Yet again a good movie is ruined. No storyline, no connection, irrelevant dialogues, pathetic delivery by actors and actresses. I must say Sam Bahadur will always be preferred over Animal because Animal has just shown good advertisement but no force. Haha. I got up before interval, sorry to say but Bobby sir should not have taken this flop. Hypothetical things, no good songs , no thrillers, i mean why this movie was made. Still people are watching it, this shows the mob culture in People. Pl guys think and then try this movie.\", \"For the starters I would say that you may love this movie or hate it, but you just can't ignore it in any caseFilm can be divided into four aspects - A) STORYLINE, B) ACTING, C) DIRECTION, and most importantly D) ACTION or VIOLENCE or simply BLOODSHED. Now below are my brief opinions on each of these aspects -A) STORYLINE - it is quite simple and mostly linear with few twists and turns. New is the father son bond that had long not been seen in any cinema. In this movie Mufasa and Simba get separated, but not for long, and what follows their union is mad mad love and madness around it.B) ACTING - acting by the cast makes this simple story very interesting and keeps you engaged for the entire runtime of the movie that is whopping three hours and 23 minutes plus few minutes of post credit scene which you can't simply miss and will leave you in awe. This role has evolved the actor in Ranbir as this one is no romantic and sweet Ranbir one is used to, this one's possessive, angry, masculine, and also, toxic. And he has played his role with absolute finesse. You get to see Rashmika's evolution too, which in latter half will leave you stunned. She has done a great job and looked pretty enough. Rest no one's average, and played their part well. Oh yeah Bobby's in here too, won't say much about him though, let it be a surprise and see it for yourself.C) DIRECTION - Sir, Sandeep Vanga Reddy had been quite upset or probably angry over the criticism his previous movie received, even though it became a box office success. However, this time he learnt the lesson well and guess what, he has responded back to the critics with a film that is even more toxic, masculine, violent and massy than his previous work beyond criticism. His direction is amazing. He has a knack for getting you engrossed from the beginning to the very end with his style of filmmaking that you start believing that you're a part of the events unfolding frame by frame and while sitting in the theatre through astral projection you've been transported into the screen and witness things right before your eyes and around you.D) ACTION/VIOLENCE/BLOODSHED - I've been fan of action and macabre stuff whether in movies or TV shows. But the bloodbath and violence that is present in this movie is unimaginable and unmatchable. This movie has for me taken everything to new bloody heights and raised the bloodied bar high enough. Before interval and nearing to climax and further it's a total RED ALERT. You may need a vomiting bag by the end. Anyway all in all violence is something that you may not like but believe me when it is not on the screen in this movie you will keep eagerly waiting for the blood to flow, muscles to collide, cuss words to be hurled at one another and sharp objects and bullets to cut and penetrate through the fleshes. It will keep the Dracula in you satiated for days.BLOODY GO FOR THIS MENACE CINEMA ASAP !!! AND DON'T MISS THE POST CREDIT SCENE !!!\", 'We must accept that the public ..the majority has widely accepted this movie.A second part is on the way.It has bagged best film .. Filmfare award.Cinematography is awesome..music is terrific..\\nAction is great..Ranbir Kapoor is exceptional.Bobby Deol is the surprise lot.Less than 20 minutes of screen appearance has created lot of appreciation.Rashmika as heroine is refreshing..\\nNew faces are required at Bollywood..\\nSo why so much hate for this movie..\\nProbably encouraged by Bollywood camp..\\nSince the director is from South industry..\\nNow we understand the poor rating.We can..talk..talk.talk.But public gives the final approval..\\nBlockbuster movie..\\n9/10.', \"This movie was a masterpiece. Once in a generation masterpiece like this will come. 3 hours of this masterpiece!Kabir Singh/Arjun Reddy was so boring, so I rated them 10. But this movie is such a masterpiece. Rating 1 also cannot define how am feeling now.Trailer was very bad. All the people who have seen the trailer will agree with me. But movie is totally opposite. Totally different. Bobby Deol, OMG, what a return. It was like rocket science. So fast that you have to experience it.This movie is not for normal people. Only legends and man of culture will hate this movie. This movie is also feminist friendly! Religious friendly!And the best part is I went to show as first day first show. I have spent my hard earned pocket money on this. Let me friend's experience the same.\", 'Director Sandeep Vanga Reddy, often accused of ruffling the feathers of self-proclaimed \"liberal critics\" with his films like Kabir Singh and Arjun Reddy, appears to have taken the criticism to heart and birthed a film that is unapologetically raw, intense, and unabashedly violent.Ranbir Kapoor\\'s portrayal of \"Animal\" is a true tour de force. He effortlessly navigates between ferocity and vulnerability, crafting a multifaceted character that keeps the audience captivated from the opening scene to the closing credits...A standout feature for me is the director\\'s choice to confront the critiques of his past works by offering a more substantial characterization for the female lead, played by Rashmika. In the second half of the film, Rashmika delivers an unexpected and impactful performance.The exploration of the relationship between father and son adds an emotional depth that goes beyond the superficial intensity. The tribute to The Godfather was rather nice.Ps: The only criticism I have is of Tripti\\'s character. I wish there was more of her...', \"Animal is a completely unexpected movie.....This is a completely fresh and new take on action dramas. Animal is not a normal movie.....it is completely crazy.It is one of the most violent movies that I have ever seen (and I have seen a lot). It is so violent that it is breaking new groundIt is 2-3 movies in one. Long but gripping from its first scene to its last. Every frame of the movie is utilized from its first second to the final second of its credit scene is part of the story.The action scenes, stunts, fights with the background music and songs are close to perfection. The action is so over the top but somehow realistic that it is mind boggling.....Think......a much more brutal, action packed and emotionally charged John Wick in a Dhoti + moreRanbir Kapoor - This is his best performance of all time. It is complex, nuanced, funny, scary and completely unhinged. This is not the chocolate face coming of age Ranbir.....he has completely mutated into something elseBobby Deol - Absolutely no words and no comments on his performance and role. Best left to be watched on screenWord of caution - Animal is not everyone's cup of tea. It will leave you gasping for air especially if you cant tolerate the sight of blood. Curse words are abundant. Dont expect to see the Ranbir of all his previous movies.....He is angry and you may not like him when he is angry.I was fully captivated by the movie and completely blown away by its pace, its story, its characters, the acting, the background music, the action, the songs....but don't take my word for it as I may be experiencing post traumatic shock. I just realized that it is also very addictive.....I am going to watch it again tomorrow. 9/10Action Cinema has changed today.\", \"This movie is garbage. What a mistake to see this. None of it made any sense. Worst movie ever. Will never Ranbir Kapoor movie my whole life. Bakwaas. How did it get a good opening? Thought it would be good because of the good opening this movie had. Rashmika is so overrated. The plot is about a son who loves his dad in the most convoluted way. Such violence and contempt for life is very unusual. Please don't go and see this movie. Not worth your time or money. I just don't get it what was the director producers of this movie we're thinking making this gorie senseless movie. I hope fails big time at box office.\", \"Mentally disturbing. No clear story. I would not recommend the movie. Only good thing about the movie is Satranga ishq song and the scene. Rashmika is just for kissing scenes, and facing the animal (heat of the beast). Any other actresses could have performance that role. She could have signed for better role. Ranbir's acting is phenomenal. But theme and story is horrible. Ranbir fights everyone for his father but listens to his advises zero times.Story: 2/10\\nActing: 8/10.First half: pointless\\nSecond half is dragged for no good reasons.For Bobby Deol, it's great comeback.I would not recommend this movie.\", \"Ranbir Kapoor's animal is full fledged Cinema. For all the cinema lovers, this is the prime time of Hindi cinema. Phenomenal performance by every individual in the film. Be it Tripti dimri, Bobby Deol, Anil kapoor, Shakti kapoor, rashmika or ranbir, everyone was extra ordinary in the film. Sandeep Reddy wanga has clearly shown how film is made. Story telling was fantastic. The cuts somewhere felt too sharp and crisp which affected next scenes. Cinematography could have been a little more better. Bgm music and all the songs are very much interesting and people just jump out of their sits when arjan velley and that scenes plays. Color Oder of the film is wonderful and looks of Ranbir Kapoor helps the audience to navigate the time and space of the scenes. There were some moments where it feels scenes are too prolonged but those were very few. Rashmika's dialogue delivery somewhere was a problem but it can be ignored in front of her performance. Overall this film has actually helped audience to open mind keys and view at larger spectrum of art.\", 'Even though the length of the movie is long, It is the most engaging bollywood movie in recent times .There is not a single dull moment. The action,story everything is awesome. I saw lot of reviews that the 2nd half is not good compared to 1st. But it is not true at all . It must be because the 1st half set the bar so high that, their expectation increased a little. You can say the 2nd half is equally good compared with the 1st half. And all songs are situational and no lip sync , that is also pretty good. At last i want to say , It is a classy bollywood movie which needs to enjoyed ,cheered and celebrated. Best movie I watched in recent time.', 'Animal is a cinematic rollercoaster that skillfully blends gripping direction, powerhouse performances, and a pulsating soundtrack. The first half is a masterclass in storytelling, with the director Sandeep Reddy Vanga weaving a tapestry of emotions and suspense. Ranbir Kapoor and Anil Kapoor steal the show with their exceptional performances, marking a significant comeback for Ranbir. Their on-screen chemistry adds depth to the narrative.The film\\'s second half, however, loses some momentum with a slower pace, leaving the audience yearning for the intensity of the initial scenes. Bobby Deol\\'s limited screen time is a missed opportunity, as his presence adds a compelling layer to the plot. Despite this, the stellar performances from the cast elevate the movie, with Ranbir Kapoor delivering a particularly impactful portrayal.Rashmika Mandanna falls slightly short of expectations, leaving room for improvement in her character portrayal. Shakti Kapoor, although a veteran actor, could have been given a meatier role to showcase his talent.The music is a standout feature, with Ajay-Atul\\'s compositions creating a mesmerizing atmosphere before the interval. B Praak\\'s song during a pivotal fight sequence is a stroke of genius, showcasing innovative thinking in the film\\'s soundtrack. The cinematography by Amit Roy and editing by Sundeep Reddy Vanga contribute to the film\\'s overall appeal.The intricate plot, spanning over 201 minutes, unfolds with layers of family dynamics, love, betrayal, and revenge. The post-credits scene sets the stage for potential sequels, adding an extra layer of intrigue for attentive viewers.In conclusion, \"Animal\" is a cinematic experience worth the watch, despite its flaws. The exceptional direction, standout performances, and memorable music make it a compelling addition to Indian cinema.', \"Action Sequences are very nicely choreographed. I must say.All Characters were good, no doubt.Songs are placed in position and I was excited for Arjan Vailly. I got wat i wanted it from.Ranbir is just wow.

How I was going to sit through nearly 3 hour 30 minutes of this drivel. Disjointed story festooned with nonsense dialogues and songs during inappropriate times. Dialogues aren't random words thrown together to fill the void. It needs to have a flow and essence to it. This was missing.Through the movie Ranbir came across as a rebel without a cause always involved in knee jerk reactions. Most of the times his reactions and expressions were mismatched. Mandana far cry from her role in Pushpa seemed, just as out of place as her accent. So no surprise she spoke mostly in English which defeats the purpose. Besides Anil Kapoor, and a couple of known faces all the actors were unknown with not much of a screen presence and that didn't help either. This isn't a love of son-father, more like a son living in a make belief world of his and having a blind obsession for his father.All in all I didn't connect with the movie at any level couldn't wait for it to finish.\", 'I was so excited about this movie and I went to watch it todat and God what a worthless movie it was!What the hell was that movie all about? Absolutely no storyline, extremely violent and that too without any reason. As far as acting is concerned, it was good, but then again what is acting worth if the storyline is absolutely nonsense!It is humble request that please stop making such nonsense! People do not pay 300-400 rupees to watch something like this, I honestly regret wasting my money on this. Moreover, it felt like it was made in opposition to feminism, seems like some really felt agonized by the idea of it! Not recommended by me at all.', 'Review of \"AnimalThe film revolves around a tale of vengeance.It\\'s steeped in emotional intensity.The narrative is marked by its intensity and volume.Central to the plot is a complex Father-Son relationship and their conflict.The protagonist adopts a \\'survival of the fittest\\' approach.He challenges the norms of a civilized society.The lead character\\'s moral judgment appears compromised.The movie features considerable violence.There is a significant presence of explicit content.Engaging and captivating until the final moments.It avoids falling into monotony.Overall, a compelling film.The message is delivered with force and clarity.', 'Three stars for:\\nthe famous (yet grossly illogical) action choreography - it was beautiful, raw and Ranbir Kapoor (RK) in his dhoti-kurta was an animal unleashed - the soundtrack made it poetic.Ranbir\\'s acting was sublime - 👌 especially his last few scenes with Anil Kapoor (in the ott version).the unconventional use of background music like the Roja music soundtrack (which I relate to innocence) is used to introduce the violent and delinquent male lead - a subliminal way of provoking contrasting emotions in the audience..\\nOnly 3 stars because even flawed characters and their actions require a story & motive - why do they what they do - what makes them who they are. I would\\'ve loved to see the dysfunctional family dynamics that made RKs character progress from juvenile delinquent to a full-blown hitman/violent person. Anil Kapoor\\'s character doesn\\'t seem that bad - I actually felt bad for him They could\\'ve made a fabulous movie focusing on the father-son relationship..\\nthe dialogues were bad - as I watched the movie-- my overarching thought was ...who talks like this? Apparently RK\\'s character has had decent education and world exposure, yet talks about slitting people\\'s throats at his company\\'s gathering/townhall and why are they all cheering? I\\'m referring to the factory scene with RK addressing the factory employees..\\nFinally, art and cinematic license allows all of us to explore the dark side of human behavior but it doesn\\'t need to be glorified. No, I\\'m in no way suggesting a moral-science class on good behavior but violence and despicable behavior in real life is not glamorous and come with consequences. So maybe an inkling of reality check would\\'ve been nice. If not, move the story to a lawless land, country, or planet so the story, lack of remorse, law and cops makes sense. Else, call it the \"Vanga Universe\" where despicable behavior and action is celebrated and rarely have any consequences.', 'What a brilliant performance by Ranbir. Absolutely thrilling. The direction is on par as well.I know this is a long movie and some action sequences do seem like a lot but the director remains successful in keeping the audience hooked. Kudos to the music director for amazing score and sound effects. The ending was totally surprising. I am so glad there were no unnecessary songs or item numbers.As the movie is rated 18 plus, it should definitely be considered before planning to go to the theater because the language, violence, and sexual references are intense. I am so excited for the next part.All in all, two thumbs up!', 'This movie is really one of a kind in terms storytelling as well as the action and character development. Really liked this movie because there is no sugar coating and everything is as it should be. Ranbir portrays the darkness that people have within them very well and this just showcases what a person can be capable of if he really puts his mind and soul to it. Talking about the characters Ranbir Kapoor and Rashmika Mandana nailed it. Anil Kapoor and all the other actors did a fantastic job. The direction is next level and it really brings the movie to life. From the start to end this movie has kept me glued to my seat. The movie is a blockbuster and I personally would like to watch this masterpiece again. Really brilliant movie by Sandeep Reddy Vanga no more words to describe it.', \"ANIMAL( Hindi /Indian movie )- My review:\\nTOTALLY ENGAGING and a crazy ride( As MB said, mental ekkuddi).I wish that this director will stay crazy ( SANKI gaadu itlaney vundaale). Story telling is just bloody fabulous. He has to be crazy to tell a story in this format .Ranbeer Kapoor blew my mind with his performance . AK brought all his experience and added the utmost importance with his acting nuances.All actors who played key roles are amazing.What I realized is that Sandeep Reddy vanga is taking us in to his crazy world and succeeding to engage us despite our usual comforts/discomforts.There are many things I wouldn't have usually appreciated but here I dare not to complain as he made them an integral part of the story and characters/ characterization.All songs are Beautiful.Back ground score is top notchAs the director said, don't miss the beginning and end.HEADS UP: This movie is rated A. I would write that in large red color A.So, NOT FOR KIDS and not for adults who are super sensitive to blood/gore and language.Be prepared for 4 hours of your time commitment including the break and ads etc.I did not feel bored or lag throughout the 3hr25 min run time.Lot more to write but I will stop here to let you guys go crazy in theater .\", \"People really need to understand the character can be problematic and yet the movie can be loved! Also it's high time we as an audience realise that it's not actor/director's responsibility of what audience is deciding to learn from their movies. So yes the Character was problematic but it's just another fictional character and shouldn't be glorified also not crucified.Now coming to the movie went to first day first show and had high expectations but I am totally satisfied. I am not a film critic I am just a normal guy who loves movies so can't go deep into analysis but here goes my review!The show was housefull as expected and atmosphere was electric! Even during intermission I could easily hear other talking about how they are loving the movie. The movie is indeed very long and I will agree second part feels stretched but it's not as bad as many people are suggesting.Songs are good and music is engaging. Watching Marathi song in fighting scene took me by a surprise and whole theatre enjoyed it!Ranbir have done phenomenal job and he is going to win bunch of awards for this role for sure. Rashmika+Ranbir combo was good but felt the chemistry could have been better. Bobby was criminally under utilised but he was top notch. Shakti Kapoor's role was very useless and couldn't grab any attention at all. Anil Kapoor was brilliant and his emotions could be felt by everyone watching.A worthy mention is small cameo of Upendra Limaye! He got a huge cheer the moment he arrived on the big screen. He showed his acting calibre in just 5 minutes. I really hope more Marathi actors like him get chance to show their craft in Bollywood.If possible go to theatres. I also believe it's rating will take a hit once it's released on OTT. People who watched in theatres and those who will watch it on OTT will have different opinions about this movie.\", 'Verdict: \"Worthu Varma Worthu\"... This is how a movie should be made - a full-time entertainer. The first half is mind-blowing with amazing music/Bg score, first-class direction, and kick-ass performances. Starting with the director, who has yet again delivered a blockbuster after Arjun Reddy. The bg score elevates the movie, and Ranbir Kapoor\\'s goosebumps-inducing acting makes the combo worth watching on the big screen. Despite a lack of a strong storyline and concept, the overall presentation and the makers\\' efforts made me enjoy the movie thoroughly. Flawless action, costume, make-up, and art direction, along with engaging dialogues, screenplay, and characters, contribute to elevating mass and heroism throughout.', \"Let's discuss main characters first -\\nRanbir's character in the first half is arousing, but magnetic and heroic because it shows high class status which is uncommon in the middle class society. But the problem is, it started getting over and the director can't balanced it out. Vanga is unable to carry that character for long in Ranbir and messed it. Most of the frames are filled with him only.Anil Kapoor didn't got much chance to perform. Although he made it through whatever chance he got but can't match with the family's physical build which represents punjabi community.Bobby deol did good acting but it's too short for a main villian and that is too when the movie is quiet big.I liked Shakti kapoor after a long time in a positive role but his character didn't suffice any purpose.Rashmika, Suresh Oberoi and Prem Chopra performed well.Storyline - It started well, and picked the pace but then before 10 min. Of the first half, it slowly getting derailed and everything started getting unreal and illogical which makes no sense at all.\", \"I was amazed by Ranbir's performance. No one can come near to what a devil role he can play. Even Rashmika was at her best. Story is superb. Only issue I found was Ranbir asking character Zoya to lick his foot, which may be justifying his character but will not go down well with female audience. Direction is superb. He has a unique style of representing events which will surprise you. So many goosebump moments will be there. And he will teach his sisters not to fall in love with any loafer but to select life partner after checking his credentials properly. A must watch film. Waiting for Animal Park release. Faadu movie hai boss.\", \"I had severe headache after watching this crazy movie..I can't imagine how crazy this director is and tortured us for 3 hours 22 minutes long knowing this is a complete omgg. Seriously if Brahmstra movie was re-released i would have watched it than this movie..Bgm was badasss but my God the story,the content all should go to dustbin..Ranbir Kapoor was in different avatar and he is looking damn fine,Bobby deol i seriously thought he will be long but hmm..Anil Kapoor lived his character and Rashmika ok. What went wrong for this movie was purely clickbait we all thought it might be like KGF movie but instead it was full of sex scenes and unnecessary Evil Dead level bloody scenes yeww i had to close my eyes. Dont ever do any movie with this crazy directior and the people who are supporting this movie idk what to comment all younger audience sadly not 18+..Harsh reality younger audience love this type of movie..Females will spit on this movie because the potrayal of woman is so bad and for sexual purposes..Many walked away from theatres here and asked for refund..Take your bp medicine or migraine pills for this movie..I wished Dunki or Salaar released along with this movie this movie should be boycotted and censor board sleeping..\", \"Wrote this review just after watching, so movie is still fresh in mind, great movie not gonna lie.Started as complete extreme, action packed, thriller ( Action and Thriller, is not for gun or fist fights, its just the vibe it gave, you will see that its not as action packed as one might have imagined from teaser, Actually trailer gave a better outlook on movie, as thats what it really is, A family, Psychological Drama with lots of emotions and love- you will feel it too later on, if you are correct audience for it. And this movie didn't shy away from blood and fight, which i loved ),Then converted into Psychological, Family Issues ( you already guessed it from trailer i think ), A unique outlook and ways of doing things ( This can't be seen in trailer, only in movie ).By the end, got very emotional ( i enjoyed that part the most, as it left a deep impact on me, so acting was top notch and emotions was right on track as it gets me ), and as always ended with complete twist ( You can only see movie for it lol ).So hands down, this was a wild ride and a great ride for me. ( At least at the moment of writing this review, i am full of emotions about the movie lol )\", 'The cry-babies are testament that their bubble has been broken. Vanga has hollered sixes over their heads in almost all directions. Gutsy, brutal and absolutely unhinged, this one is not for the high-priests of morality, and definitely not for activists. Ranbir Kapoor has delivered in what is probably his career-best. Anil Kapoor is brilliant as well. It was a pleasure to find Bobby Deol in such a deliciously evil avatar, probably for the first time in his career. The story leaves you eager for more, which is up next, in Animal Park.The songs, particularly \"Satranga\" are very good.There are a lot of political subtexts which have ruffled feathers in a lot of birds. Just that they can\\'t bring \\'em up, that\\'s why the \\'vidhwa-vilaap\\' regarding misogyny and blah blah blah.That hand-gesture at the post-credits spells out a new term, Vangaism. The hand-gesture also indicates exactly how important critics and feminists are to Vanga.And to us.Run to the theatre, NOW, and experience the insanity.', \"Villian came 10 min before and died just like that bobby deol did not even kill 2 or 5 people but ranvir killed 400 or 500 people but because he is hero than 😅\\nHe says he an alpha and he will never betray but have affairs even when he has kids\\nAnd the female actor can't even speak the dialogues 😅\\nI think for a climatic experience movie was good but from society and your own moral view you cannot accept some scenes from this movie\\nRanvir acting was nice ,but Bobby deol only came for a cameo that's it his character should be written again and then at least he will fight the hero properly\\nNot so great movie just ok ok and very nice in action category\\nBut the second half is, no action just drama and that's it.\", \"Adter a long time back watched a good film, watched with like 500 people at the theatre and every moment was worth it. Director really had an clear vision how the story goes in the movie. You can't expect what's gonna happen next and that the beauty. Although like any otter movie its also not free from its drawback. Like 2nd half is little stretched out, some dialogue could have been precise, in one fight scene even though ranveer had supporter he killed 200 people with an axe which was little hard to consume. But rest all everything was perfect. Cinematography, the wow moments, the amazing story, the punjabi swagger vibes, guns, background music, director vision, the transitions, costume etc are all everything are perfect done. Some dialogue are so punching that watching with 500 people when everyone laughing really made the vibes soo good. Watched it and banglore and there is a dialogue that says imagined in delhi, manufactured in BANGLORE, assembled in mumbai, (atmanirbhar bharat); when people heard the word banglore people really screamed and i got goosebumps from it. Dialogues are not that filmy, not that typical movie dialogue, its all genuine.Nowadays most of indian movie gives kind of a vibes of south india movies but this movie was different, it didn't had that south vibes rather delhi and punjabi vibes fully. Movie enthusiasts must watch this without reading further more review and trust me you won't regret your time. My day has really well spend today all i am saying.\", \"Animal film starring Ranbir Kapoor, is an absolute cinematic triumph that captivates audiences with its gripping narrative and stellar performances. Kapoor's portrayal of his character adds depth and authenticity to the story, showcasing his versatility as an actor. The film seamlessly weaves together elements of drama, suspense, and emotion, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats from start to finish.The cinematography is breathtaking, with each frame meticulously crafted to enhance the perfect movie that I have been waiting for part 2 this is really wonderful movies the superb movie scenes...\", \"First half peaks, second half lot of psychoism. Movie is portrayed as father son love story. Where as Rashmikas love was more powerful. Character selection was too good. All main characters and side characters from Mishra to translator were well established and has value. Background score elevated scenes to peak. Ranbir did excellent acting as well Rashmikas. Anil Kapoor did excellent job showing his mood in expressions as a concerned father with fear inside and brave heart outside. Bobby deol too was excellent in his brief presence. Overall it's a different psychic experience and only for adults, when it comes in OTT only watch without kids presence.\", 'This movie is cinematically so great. Well acted, scenes full of emotion, well edited, good cameos and also good action scenes. Overall great experience to watch in threater. Do not think it will be same feeling in OTT.It does represent alpha male concept as every one is talking. But one thing I would say is it does not try to glorify that. While watching movie we all feel like Ranbir is psycho obsessed with his father and also as a viewer it does not try to convince me that it is write for what Ranbir did. I still feel like Ranbir was wrong at so many level and did so many wrong things. I did not feel glorified. Movie trying to compare alpha male concept with animal instinct and not saying it should be normal human. We have evolved so much like human and we act differently but in parallel universe if we were like animal we would act like in the movie. I think that is what movie is trying to say.']\n",

And this movie didn't shy away from blood and fight, which i loved ),Then converted into Psychological, Family Issues ( you already guessed it from trailer i think ), A unique outlook and ways of doing things ( This can't be seen in trailer, only in movie ).By the end, got very emotional ( i enjoyed that part the most, as it left a deep impact on me, so acting was top notch and emotions was right on track as it gets me ), and as always ended with complete twist ( You can only see movie for it lol ).So hands down, this was a wild ride and a great ride for me.

He pulled it off with such ease and elevated the movie on another level. It is a well shot movie in my opinion and vanga has made a great movie to showcase the acting skills of such a great talent. The 1st half of the movie is amazing and goes with such smoothness. I felt the movie dip a bit in the second half and that romance angle could've been out to the side. Bobby Deol was a game changer but really underutilized. He should've gotten more screen time and a better backstory. Anil Kapoor as well was amazing and did a great job with his given role. The movie won't bore you at all because Ranbir Kapoor is taking up almost all of the 3 hours in this movie and he makes you wanna sit there and admire his work in each frame. The violence in the movie is gritty but not as much as I expected it to be. But overall, a good movie with great acting and also, do not take your kids. You will regret it.\n",

While M's world is high on technology and the city's night skyline is dotted with high rises, Prasanth Varma contrasts this with the town of Anjanadri, flanked by mountains, valleys and a larger-than-life rock carving of Hanuman.The underdog in this story is Hanumanthu (Teja Sajja), a happy go lucky guy who lives with his sister Anjamma (Varalaxmi Sarathkumar).

Characters popped in and out of scenes with no clear motivation or purpose, leaving me perplexed and utterly disengaged from their fates.Furthermore, the individual scenes seemed to serve no function other than to waste precious minutes of my life. I struggled to find any semblance of meaning or significance in the endless stream of dialogue and action. At times, it felt as though the filmmakers were simply throwing ideas at the wall in the hope that something would stick, but alas, nothing did.To add insult to injury, the movie clocked in at an excruciating three-plus hours. Three hours of my life that I will never get back. I found myself checking the time, hoping against hope that the end was nigh, only to discover that I still had another hour of agony to endure.

Also it's high time we as an audience realise that it's not actor/director's responsibility of what audience is deciding to learn from their movies. So yes the Character was problematic but it's just another fictional character and shouldn't be glorified also not crucified.Now coming to the movie went to first day first show and had high expectations but I am totally satisfied. I am not a film critic I am just a normal guy who loves movies so can't go deep into analysis but here goes my review!The show was housefull as expected and atmosphere was electric! Even during intermission I could easily hear other talking about how they are loving the movie. The movie is indeed very long and I will agree second part feels stretched but it's not as bad as many people are suggesting.Songs are good and music is engaging. Watching Marathi song in fighting scene took me by a surprise and whole theatre enjoyed it!Ranbir have done phenomenal job and he is going to win bunch of awards for this role for sure. Rashmika+Ranbir combo was good but felt the chemistry could have been better. Bobby was criminally under utilised but he was top notch. Shakti Kapoor's role was very useless and couldn't grab any attention at all. Anil Kapoor was brilliant and his emotions could be felt by everyone watching.A worthy mention is small cameo of Upendra Limaye! He got a huge cheer the moment he arrived on the big screen. He showed his acting calibre in just 5 minutes. I really hope more Marathi actors like him get chance to show their craft in Bollywood.If possible go to theatres. I also believe it's rating will take a hit once it's released on OTT. People who watched in theatres and those who will watch it on OTT will have different opinions about this movie.\n",

It's HANUMAN, and movie ensure that the audience don't loose focus of it with great cinematography, character and place namings, symbolism, and ofcourse the story arc itself.The Introductory piece of the movie is done in Rajumauli Style ( for the sake of familiarity) and is done nearly as well. You could always see that the VFX team never had enough budget to go all guns blazing. But at the same time, it was evident that they brought all the sincerity and intent to make the best of the available resources and almost always got the basics of VFX right, be it underwater scene, or others.Post the Introductory scene, it takes you through a storyline where arguably it helps to the submit to the director's way of storytelling. In no way, director stretches the style of storytelling and uses extreme exaggeration that we are not already accustomed to Superhero cinema ( in India and beyond) but seeing it being done by not some A listers might through viewers off a little.And post that movie completely submerged itself into a well crafted masala entertainer. Who is the lead before he gets power, how he gets power, how it changes the small villege, how the antagonist and protagonist meets makes the main plot, with his love story, and villege political dynamics makes up the secondary plot on which the rest of movie revolves.But what gets you the screaming on top of your lungs Jai Shri Ram at the end of the movie is the climax that fills you with pride and anticipation of what is going to come next.I watched it in Hindi and the dubbing was pretty neat. A good indicator of that is always how the comedy scenes are dubbed and it was done well to get the hearty laugh out of the audience.WATCH IT TODAY.\n",

The first half of the film is mostly overwrought familial drama and, to be honest, I was quite bored, much of the cultural stuff that seemed to be entertaining the largely Indian audience going way over my head. There weren't even any elaborate song and dance numbers to lighten the mood (I thought musical numbers were mandatory in Bollywood movies).I did, however, perk up when, immediately before the interval, the first action scene occurs, as anti-hero Ranvijay Singh (Ranbir Kapoor) hacks away at countless animal mask wearing enemy henchmen with a pair of axes before mounting a vehicle armed with enormous machine guns and blasting the remaining bad guys into oblivion. If this was an indication of the cartoonish OTT violence to come in the second half, I figured the hard slog of the past 90 minutes would have been worthwhile.Unfortunately, that blistering action scene proves to be the highlight of the whole film: the remainder of the film consists of more drama that seems to be building towards an exciting testosterone-fuelled climax but which culminates in a less than thrilling bout of fisticuffs between Ranvijay and villain Abrar Haque (Bobby Deol).5/10. I might have enjoyed it more if I had understood some of the humour, and, with such a long runtime, I think there should have been much more action, and at least one highly choreographed musical interlude (the song sung by Ranjivay's 'brothers' during the fight scene doesn't count).N.

The first half is a masterclass in storytelling, with the director Sandeep Reddy Vanga weaving a tapestry of emotions and suspense. Ranbir Kapoor and Anil Kapoor steal the show with their exceptional performances, marking a significant comeback for Ranbir. Their on-screen chemistry adds depth to the narrative.The film's second half, however, loses some momentum with a slower pace, leaving the audience yearning for the intensity of the initial scenes. Bobby Deol's limited screen time is a missed opportunity, as his presence adds a compelling layer to the plot. Despite this, the stellar performances from the cast elevate the movie, with Ranbir Kapoor delivering a particularly impactful portrayal.Rashmika Mandanna falls slightly short of expectations, leaving room for improvement in her character portrayal. Shakti Kapoor, although a veteran actor, could have been given a meatier role to showcase his talent.The music is a standout feature, with Ajay-Atul's compositions creating a mesmerizing atmosphere before the interval. B Praak's song during a pivotal fight sequence is a stroke of genius, showcasing innovative thinking in the film's soundtrack. The cinematography by Amit Roy and editing by Sundeep Reddy Vanga contribute to the film's overall appeal.The intricate plot, spanning over 201 minutes, unfolds with layers of family dynamics, love, betrayal, and revenge. The post-credits scene sets the stage for potential sequels, adding an extra layer of intrigue for attentive viewers.In conclusion, \"Animal\" is a cinematic experience worth the watch, despite its flaws.

Turns out, it is actually the supervillain's origin story. I absolutely loved the film. I was having a deja-vu, then I remembered he was also the villain in Tamil superhero film Veeran.I love that they make self-aware jokes about Telugu masala filmmaking and how Telugu heroes are already superheroes. Story works, humour works, origin stories work, action and visuals work big time. What Prashanth Varma has managed to accomplish with the budget is nothing short of mindblowing. Why was that monkey giving commentary lmao.It's a brilliant integration of Indian mythology into science fiction/superhero genre although I do believe using Hindu gods directly in fictional narratives for entertainment is not right and is almost indistinguishable from the use of Greek, Norse, Egyptian gods in western films, shows or video games because they aren't worshipped anymore. In any case, this is a promising start to the Prashanth Varma Cinematic Universe and I will be there for Adhira and Jai Hanuman.This is a proper superhero film. So expect lots of gadgets, drones, body freezing gas, smoke bombs, science fiction like monitor displays on thin air, superpowered suits but the thing to note here is that these are all used by the supervillain. Rat bodies explode in experiments gone wrong and there is a fair amount of blood too. Pretty cool visuals and not only are most of the ideas never seen before in an Indian film but the film also promises a whole lot more. The last 15 minutes are simply amazing to say the least. Trust me, you just have to see it with your own eyes. Theater experience is something else. Hats off to Prashanth Varma. Jai Hanuman! Jai Shree Ram!\n",

            "Fortunately, we have gone past the era where simplest of acting skills were missing in lead actors. Almost everyone in this film did what was expected from them.THE CONTENT(STORY):Superhero origin stories are risky, usually missing the mark. This one was different. The story was engaging, comic relief was organic and certainly not over the top. The self-awareness of the characters and the situations around them kept the story grounded. The script was slightly fast paced and somewhat rushed in the second half(typical of Indian films). While the hero's screen time and character arc was well maintained, the antagonist's character was not completely developed. The love story sub plot was managed well.Comedy does not seem imposed and is at no point in time offensive.THE DIRECTION:There were goosebump worthy moments which is a novelty in Indian Superhero films. You will clap a few times. The director certainly was not aiming for classic realism in a superhero film. It has very little artsy and way more mass entertainment. The director knows how to stir up the emotions when watching the film on big screen and he seems to be the right candidate for creating a Cinematic Universe.CGI:In a 20 Crore budget, you cannot expect Avenger level VFX. From the look of it, every single penny is spent judiciously. One would like to see more detailing in superhero fight scenes in the next movies of the Universe.LASTLY:If you are not really trying to be preachy and offensive, audience is smart enough to accept the story at its face value. It has not been the case on most occasions.The way the makers have treated a sensitive topic is commendable..Telugu and other South Indian story writers, actors and directors are way ahead of Bollywood.Indian Myth is a Goldmine for marvellous stories which have been ignored, deliberately. And the adaptations have been disappointing. This movie proves that if unwarranted propaganda is not peddled through film and the content more than the messaging is prioritised, India can make engaging superhero films for the world.

            "So, I've finally returned home from the evening screening of \"Animal,\" and I have a lot to talk about, so let's get started.Positives:-1. Ranbir Kapoor - In a nutshell, fabulous! I've always admired this man and his natural acting abilities; Vanga has really taken him to the next level, and Ranbir has absolutely dedicated himself to the role he plays. You can absolutely question or even condemn the character for the choices he makes, but you cannot overlook the exceptional acting on display.2. Action & Violence - The second strongest aspect of this execution, and to be honest, we all knew it coming. Vanga pledged to deliver violence, and he kept his word. One of the most spectacular scenes of combat (the interval block) produced in Indian cinema. However, some viewers accustomed to Hollywood or international cinema may find the gore unsatisfactory!3. Confrontation Sequences - There are three main ones in the film (Ranvijay and Varun, Ranvijay and Geetanjali, and Ranvijay and Balbir), and all three had a tremendous impact on me. Wonderful work!Negatives:-1. Lack of Emotional Drive - There was enough of drama and tension in the narrative, with a revenge factor at the forefront, but I couldn't connect to the protagonist's motive or drive, or any of the other characters for that matter. This is mostly caused by a lack of emotional depth, which has robbed the narration of its desired attribute.2. Father-Son Dynamic Wastage - Every promotional material for the feature suggested a neatly constructed Father-Son relationship, with multiple layers and shades to explore and examine. However, that did not happen, and we were forced to settle for a one-dimensional portrayal of the said dynamic, which felt too banal, too rudimentary.3. Choppy Editing and Incoherent Writing - Those who know my film preferences and palate know how much I advocate for non-linear storytelling and experimental filmmaking, but that's only applicable if the script has a certain flow to it and the narration doesn't dither about its main course at play. \"Animal\" unfortunately loses its way in the middle, especially during the second half.Mixed:-1. Humour - A couple of lines made me laugh, but the rest of the lines constituted for comedy fell flat and looked unwarranted and out of place!2. Music - Songs like Arjan Vailly, Papa Meri Jaan, and Pehle Bhi Main matched the story gracefully and immediately pulled me in, but other tracks like Satranga and Saari Duniya Jalaa Denge were criminally underutilised.3. Bobby Deol as Abrar Haque - The look of Bobby created so much buzz on social media that a large number of people (including me) were ecstatic to see him in a dark, sinister avatar like never before, but Sandeep Reddy Vanga had other intentions. It's a shame to see a veteran like Bobby given only fifteen minutes of screen time, and that without the requisite amount of depth or context, resulting in a half-baked cameo at best!4. The Rest of the Supporting Cast - Rashmika, who played both the romantic interest and the wife, did a good job in a number of scenes (particularly near the end), but her character only had so much to express. Tripti Dimri, who played Zoya, had an even smaller role, which seemed unfair to me given her talent as an actor. Anil Kapoor, on the other hand, didn't have much to do except get upset and yell at his wife and children. Monotony hits again!Conclusion: If you know what you're getting yourself into, I feel you'll be able to get the most out of this show; if not, better to proceed with caution.\n",

            "For the starters I would say that you may love this movie or hate it, but you just can't ignore it in any caseFilm can be divided into four aspects - A) STORYLINE, B) ACTING, C) DIRECTION, and most importantly D) ACTION or VIOLENCE or simply BLOODSHED. Now below are my brief opinions on each of these aspects -A) STORYLINE - it is quite simple and mostly linear with few twists and turns. New is the father son bond that had long not been seen in any cinema. In this movie Mufasa and Simba get separated, but not for long, and what follows their union is mad mad love and madness around it.B) ACTING - acting by the cast makes this simple story very interesting and keeps you engaged for the entire runtime of the movie that is whopping three hours and 23 minutes plus few minutes of post credit scene which you can't simply miss and will leave you in awe. This role has evolved the actor in Ranbir as this one is no romantic and sweet Ranbir one is used to, this one's possessive, angry, masculine, and also, toxic. And he has played his role with absolute finesse. You get to see Rashmika's evolution too, which in latter half will leave you stunned. She has done a great job and looked pretty enough. Rest no one's average, and played their part well. Oh yeah Bobby's in here too, won't say much about him though, let it be a surprise and see it for yourself.C) DIRECTION - Sir, Sandeep Vanga Reddy had been quite upset or probably angry over the criticism his previous movie received, even though it became a box office success. However, this time he learnt the lesson well and guess what, he has responded back to the critics with a film that is even more toxic, masculine, violent and massy than his previous work beyond criticism. His direction is amazing. He has a knack for getting you engrossed from the beginning to the very end with his style of filmmaking that you start believing that you're a part of the events unfolding frame by frame and while sitting in the theatre through astral projection you've been transported into the screen and witness things right before your eyes and around you.D) ACTION/VIOLENCE/BLOODSHED - I've been fan of action and macabre stuff whether in movies or TV shows. But the bloodbath and violence that is present in this movie is unimaginable and unmatchable. This movie has for me taken everything to new bloody heights and raised the bloodied bar high enough. Before interval and nearing to climax and further it's a total RED ALERT. You may need a vomiting bag by the end. Anyway all in all violence is something that you may not like but believe me when it is not on the screen in this movie you will keep eagerly waiting for the blood to flow, muscles to collide, cuss words to be hurled at one another and sharp objects and bullets to cut and penetrate through the fleshes. It will keep the Dracula in you satiated for days.BLOODY GO FOR THIS MENACE CINEMA ASAP !!! AND DON'T MISS THE POST CREDIT SCENE !!!\n",

Moreover, it looks like they didn't pay the editor his fee and he took his revenge by editing this movie in a psychotic manner. I am struggling to find any character in this movie who is NOT a psychopath (and that includes the primary school teacher who spanks the kids hand with cane for no good reason) or a complete moron (like some of the house staff shown in the movie). Ranbir's wife is shown as a nice sweet girl in the beginning but appears to get a bit unhinged in the later part of the movie.There is no Police to be found anywhere in the movie even as hundreds (perhaps thousands) are shot point blank. Ranbir's character kills his brother-in-law with his bare hands in a crowded corporate event but clearly everyone forgot to report the murder as Ranbir's wife was clueless until much later in the movie.Ranbir goes from surgeries to heart transplant to get super fit to fight a brutal fight in months. While he is supposedly recovering there are a few odd earthy jokes (or supposed to be jokes) thrown in between his sudden psychotic rants. Ranbir's obsession with his dad is not only unbelievable but poorly explained. Ranbir's dad (Anil Kapoor) is yet another psychopath who is shown to be screaming at the top of his lungs for most of his scenes.Perhaps all these crazy characters in the first half make the villain (Bobby Deol) look relatively sane when he comes in. Thankfully he is mute so he doesn't go on crazy rants (making him look a bit cooler than the main character)All in all, the storyline is non existent, one scene jumps to another without any coherence or logical consistency. It is a typical masala movie formula -- come up with a few scenes (violent fight scene, sex scene, comedy scenes) first and then somehow put all of them together.I am surprised that this movie was such a big hit despite of all its errors. I can only conclude that it was meant to appeal to beta males who dream of being a macho man. In that sense this movie does seem to succeed. After all, the senseless twists and turns may be just as probable (or improbable) as the beta's dream of becoming an alpha one day.\n",

            "\"Animal\": A Critical Exploration of a Film Lost in SenselessnessAs I jot down these words amidst the second half of \"Animal\" unfolding on the big screen, my overwhelming sentiment is one of bewilderment. Who, in the realm of cinematic creation, birthed this perplexing narrative? The script, devoid of coherence, stands as a testament to senselessness, leaving me grappling with the bewildering plot-or rather, the lack thereof.At its core, \"Animal\" seems to revel in the absence of a substantial storyline. It's as if the creators tossed logic aside in favor of a chaotic collage of scenes that lack cohesion. A film should engage, challenge, and provoke thought, yet \"Animal\" seems content to meander aimlessly, leaving the audience with nothing to grasp onto.The script, a crucial backbone for any cinematic endeavor, emerges as the weakest link in this production. Dialogue exchanges feel forced, devoid of the nuanced subtleties that breathe life into well-crafted conversations. The characters navigate through a maze of inanity, their motivations and actions appearing arbitrary and detached from any discernible plot structure. It's a cinematic puzzle with pieces that refuse to fit together.The most disheartening aspect of \"Animal\" is its apparent catering to insecure masculine fantasies. The film lingers on tropes and clichés that perpetuate a narrow and regressive view of masculinity. Rather than offering a nuanced exploration of characters and relationships, it panders to a dated and one-dimensional perspective. This reliance on tired stereotypes does a disservice to both the audience and the potential the film may have had for genuine exploration and reflection.A film devoid of a compelling plot and meaningful character development can only sustain itself through other means-cinematography, perhaps, or a stellar cast. However, \"Animal\" struggles even on these fronts. The visual composition lacks a distinct identity, failing to elevate the mundane script into a visually arresting experience. Despite a cast that may possess individual talents, the collective chemistry falls flat, hindered by the weight of a directionless narrative.In the midst of this cinematic quagmire, it's essential to acknowledge that subjective preferences play a role in shaping one's perception of a film. Some may find solace in the visual aesthetics or draw enjoyment from the chaotic meandering, but for those seeking substance and coherence, \"Animal\" leaves much to be desired.In conclusion, \"Animal\" emerges as a film adrift in the vast ocean of senselessness. Its script, void of logic, and plot, caters to the lowest common denominator, perpetuating stereotypes that undermine the potential for genuine exploration. While a film can be forgiven for its shortcomings, the absence of a cohesive narrative and meaningful character development renders \"Animal\" a forgettable and frustrating cinematic experience. As the credits roll, one is left pondering not the intricacies of the plot, but the inexplicable choices that led to the creation of this cinematic enigma.\n",

When Balbir Singh is attacked, Vijay comes back seeking vengeance and all hell breaks loose. Who attacked Balbir? What is their connection with Balbir's family? Will Vijay ever get tired of devouring his demons, forms rest of the story.Sandeep Reddy Vanga got triggered a lot due to the harsh criticism he received for Kabir Singh from a small section of critics and vowed to make the most violent film, which he succeeds. He didn't say anything about making a good film and that reflects in the second half. For what it's worth, the 1hr 45mins long first half was indeed terrific and Ranbir Kapoor is presented in never seen before avatar (not just Ranbir but any Bollywood hero in general). The non-linear narrative helps and so does the excessive violence. Everything Vanga has cooked up in the first half worked superbly.The second half is where the film stumbled big time as the weak script and barring Ranbir's Vijay, every other character being underwritten, badly pulls down the film. Excessive of everything will become unbearable and that is exactly what happens in the second half. Atleast the first half had hero elevations and gave him a purpose to help connect with the character. But in the second half, the writing undoes everything turning Vijay into this massive jerk than an animal and it is only Ranbir's performance that tries to be the film's savior.Speaking of underwritten roles, it is exactly here where Sandeep Reddy Vanga fails.

We are told the reason for the enmity between Balbir's family and that of Abrar Haque (Bobby Deol) but it is never effectively established what their backstory was. It simply settles to bunch of wild nasty men going at each other with unnecessary amount of violence. Even Tripti Dimri's Zoya is so poorly written, the character's action at the crucial point made no sense whatsoever.Coming back to Vijay and Geetanjali's (Rashmika) relationship, it is somewhat an extended version of Arjun-Preeti / Kabir-Preeti though Geetanjali gets to take charge of couple of situations, only to give in. Just having the couple talk about their sex life openly or even fight using sex in the argument alone isn't enough to sell their love story. Anil Kapoor's Balbir sadly gets sidelined in the second half, only to get a proper scene in the end. All of this is what makes the entire second half feel so empty. But, the post credit scene was indeed very good.Overall, Ranbir Kapoor's terrific performance definitely deserved a better second half. I am going with a lenient rating just for that first half, Ranbir Kapoor and the post credit scene.\n",
